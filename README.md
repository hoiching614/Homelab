# My Homelab Infrastructure

This repository documents my homelab, which I use to practice and showcase skills in **virtualization, containerization, storage, and systems administration**.  
It serves as a personal lab environment where I deploy services, experiment with automation, and simulate production-like workloads.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Hardware Environment

- **Server**: Supermicro H12SSL-NT  
- **CPU**: AMD EPYC 7543 (32 cores, 64 threads)  
- **Memory**: 256 GiB DDR4 ECC (Multi-bit)  

---
## ðŸ”¹ Local LLM Deployment

LM Studio Integration: Deployed local Large Language Models on high-performance AMD Ryzen AI Max+ hardware for personal experiments and automation.

Use Cases:

- **Automating system monitoring and log analysis
- **Generating scripts and command sequences for infrastructure tasks
- **Natural language interaction with homelab services and dashboards

## ðŸ”¹ AI-Enhanced Automation

- **Task Scheduling & Automation: Combined Celery and LLM-based reasoning to trigger system actions intelligently.
- **Data Processing Pipelines: Used LLMs for structured/unstructured data analysis from logs, web scraping, and system metrics.
- **Integration with Existing Services: LLM workflows interact with Docker containers, VMs, and monitoring tools for real-time insights and suggestions.

## ðŸ”¹ Skills Demonstrated

- **Local LLM deployment and optimization on high-core-count hardware
- **Python scripting for AI integration with backend services
- **Automating repetitive infrastructure tasks using intelligent agents=
- **Experimentation with offline AI inference for secure, low-latency workflows
